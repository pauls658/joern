15648 - decodeHeader with $body
15623 - decodeHeader with $body
141256 - decodeHeader with mime_print_lines $body
16458 - mailprio tainted from showInputForm $values, everything put into an array thing
15595 - showInputForm $values taints the var $identity, which is used as an array index in $idents, which taints $signature
16237 - very likely decodeHeader causing taintedness
15409 - uses showInputForm $subject
15731 - uses showInputForm $body
15700 - signature is tainted by same mechanism as 15595
15160 - substr calls are tainted, all use vars taken out of showInputForm $values
15572 - signature is tainted from same mechanism as 15595
15677 - same as above
